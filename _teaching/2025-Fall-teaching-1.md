The "Digital Lab Pro" is an advanced-level class of the course, designed for students interested in digital circuit design, system architecture design, and related areas. It has been successfully offered for six years.


Course Overview
===
This course series of experiments enables students to design fundamental digital system components and simple digital systems. It aims to help students become proficient in using hardware description languages (HDLs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), and electronic design automation (EDA) tools, mastering the methods and techniques for designing and implementing digital systems. The course lays a solid foundation for students' subsequent design of computer processors (CPUs) and hardware systems, and also cultivates participants for the current NSCSCC "Loongson Cup" competition.
